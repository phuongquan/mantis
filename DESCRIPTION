Description: Generate interactive html reports that enable quick visual review of multiple 
    related time series stored in a data frame. For static datasets, this can help to identify any temporal 
    artefacts that may affect the validity of subsequent analyses. For live data feeds, 
    regularly scheduled reports can help to pro-actively identify data feed problems
    or unexpected trends that may require action. The reports are self-contained and shareable 
    without a web server.
